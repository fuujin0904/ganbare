# AngularJS Gabaru Application

## Overview

This application takes the developer through the process of building a web-application using
angular. The application is loosely based on the **Google Phone Gallery**, 

## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-github].
- Git [home][git-home] (download, documentation).

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node-download].
- Install the tool dependencies (`npm install`).

## Development with ganbare app

The following docs describe how you can test and develop further this application.


### Installing dependencies

The application relies upon various node.js tools, such as Bower, Karma and Protractor.  You can
install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run bower, which will download the angular files needed for the current step of the
tutorial.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.
